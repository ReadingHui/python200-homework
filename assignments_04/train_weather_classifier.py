# The test AUC score is 0.8529, which means the model's quality is high, it can differentiate the classes nicely.
# It is about what I would expect, as the weather of LA are in general warmer, which means for the most part the model is linear
# except for only around 50 days where the highest temperature is lower than 18C. Hence the Logistic Regression model should work good.
# In the report, the FP and FN are on average the same, in predicting non-good days, FP is less than FN, while in predicting good days,
# FP is more than FN. In practice, I would like the FP to be lower, as a FP means people will prepare to run even though it is not a good
# day, which causes inconvenience if they prepared the running shoes or schedule. A FN is merely losing out a good day that they can 
# potentially run. Hence, I would rather the app under-recommend it.
# If I were to set the threshold for the real app, I would use a value higher than 0.5, this pushes the FP rate lower as it is harder for
# the model to flag a good day, that makes the model less prone to over-recommendation.
